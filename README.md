This was my final project in my second year Server Side module at Staffordshire University. 

The task for this was to create a web app that would allow users to order a pizza using laravel. There was no design aspect to this as it is only to show server side skills. 

The key components that I learnt from this project are:
    <br>
    -How to initialize a Laravel Project.
    <br>
    -Using blade templates to show manipulated data.
    <br>
    -Creating and using Controllers and Models. 
    <br>
    -Implementing SOLID principles and correct object oriented programming skills.
